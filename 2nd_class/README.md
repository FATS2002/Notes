#### cmds
1. write cmds to operate Normal windows.
####  1. Windows Commands for Basic Operations
- **Open Command Prompt:** `cmd`
- **List Directory:** dir
- **Change Directory:** `cd [directory_name]`

7. what is virtualization

8. what is virtualMachine.why we use vm
A Virtual Machine  is a software emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system & apps just like a physical machine.

10. what is HTTP and HTTPS.
11. what is SSH and telnet.  
SSH (Secure Shell): A protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network. Port Number: 22.
Telnet: A protocol for remote login that is not secure. It sends data in plain text. Port Number: 23.

13. what is VLAN and VPN
14. fullform of SMTP & portNo
15. portNo of HTTP & DHCP
16. VNC &NTP portNo
17. FTP control portNo.
18. SMP portNo
19. NTPA. 389  .  **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**: Port 123 , **LDAP**: Port 389
20. what is protocol .How many protocols
    A protocol is a set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data over a network. There are numerous protocols, each serving different purposes:
- HTTP/HTTPS: For web browsing.
- FTP/SFTP: For file transfers.
- SMTP/IMAP/POP3: For email.
- DNS: For domain name resolution.
- DHCP: For dynamic IP address assignment.
- SSH/Telnet: For remote access.
- NTP: For time synchronization.
- VPN: For secure remote access.
- VLAN: For network segmentation
- 
22. IMAP portNo   port -143
23. SMTP portNo.  port  -25
24. SMTPS portNo. port -465
25. FTP & FTPS-FTP secure or not
